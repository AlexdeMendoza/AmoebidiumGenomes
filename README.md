# Amoebidium Genomes 
 The data and code used for the Amoebidium genome project.
 It is divided into 4 folders:

## Reference Genome
 This folder contains the reference chromosome scale genome for *Amoebidium appalachense* and all the associated annotation files. 
 
## Phylogenies
 This folder contains the original fasta files used to build the alignments and the resulting IQtree phylogenies in Newick format. 
 
## Differential Expression
 This folder contains the TEcounts outputs for both control and 5-Azacytidine treatments for *Amoebidium appalachense* and *Sphaeroforma arctica*.
 
## Isolates
 This folder contains the genomes of the two alternative isolate genomes, a *Amoebidium appalachense* (Isolate 9181) and a *Amoebidium parasiticum* genome (Isolate 9257).

###Code
 
Then the Analysis Script covers the R code to generate the analysis of the various graphics in the paper.
