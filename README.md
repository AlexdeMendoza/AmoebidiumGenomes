# Amoebidium Genomes 
 The data and code used for the Amoebidium genome project.
 
 Genome assembly and raw genomic reads can be found here: PRJEB68378.
 
 EM-seq and RNA-seq raw data can be found here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE249241
 
 This repository includes processed files and is divided into 5 folders:

## Reference Genome
 This folder contains the reference chromosome scale genome for *Amoebidium appalachense* and all the associated annotation files. 
 
## Phylogenies
 This folder contains the original fasta files used to build the alignments and the resulting IQtree phylogenies in Newick format. 
 
## Differential Expression
 This folder contains the TEcounts outputs for both control and 5-Azacytidine treatments for *Amoebidium appalachense* and *Sphaeroforma arctica*.
 
## Isolates
 This folder contains the genomes of the two alternative isolate genomes, an isolate of *Amoebidium appalachense* (9181) and an isolate of *Amoebidium parasiticum* (9257).

## Code
 A collection of scripts that covers the R code used to generate the analysis of the various graphics in the paper.
